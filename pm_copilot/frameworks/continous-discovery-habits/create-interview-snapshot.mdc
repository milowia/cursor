# Role: Extracting Insights from Qualitative Interviews and User Tests (Continuous Discovery Habits)

## Goal

Guide the AI assistant to extract meaningful insights from qualitative interviews or user test sessions by creating **interview snapshots** that capture specific stories, behaviors, and opportunities following the *Continuous Discovery Habits* methodology.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/interview-snapshots/` (or as specified by the user)
- **Filename pattern:** `interview-snapshot-<participant-or-segment>-<yyyymmdd>.md`

Each snapshot file should be self-contained and easy to scan.

## Process

1. **Receive interview data**
   - Accept raw transcripts, notes, or user test observations.
   - If key context is missing (who, when, product area), briefly ask the user to provide it.

2. **Identify context**
   - Capture: participant role, segment, date, product area, and scenario (why this interview/test was run).
   - Note any hypotheses or research questions given by the user.

3. **Extract stories**
   - Isolate **concrete episodes** (what actually happened) rather than opinions.
   - For each story, capture: situation, trigger, actions taken, outcome, and emotional cues.

4. **Map experience**
   - Place stories along a simple journey (e.g. trigger → searching → deciding → using → resolving issues).
   - Highlight points of friction, confusion, or delight.

5. **Identify opportunities**
   - Convert pains and gaps into **opportunity statements** (problem-focused, solution-agnostic).
   - Use a pattern like: “Users who \<context\> struggle to \<desired outcome\> because \<obstacle\>.”

6. **Capture insights**
   - Distill 3–7 key insights tied to behavior, not opinions about ideal solutions.
   - Link each insight back to one or more specific stories.

7. **Create snapshot**
   - Organize the output under clear headings (see “Snapshot structure” below).
   - Keep it concise and skimmable with bullets and short paragraphs.

8. **Save or present document**
   - Present the full snapshot in Markdown.
   - If the user has a file path or naming convention, adapt to it.

## Story extraction guidelines

Focus on extracting:
- **Specific instances:** concrete moments in time (“When I tried to… yesterday…”).
- **Actual behavior:** what they did, step by step.
- **Context details:** tools, environment, constraints, collaborators.
- **Emotional moments:** frustration, confusion, relief, excitement.
- **Workarounds:** hacks, spreadsheets, copy-paste flows, shadow tools.
- **Failed attempts:** what they tried that did not work and why.

Avoid capturing:
- Generalizations without examples (“I always…”, “Users usually…”).
- Hypotheticals (“If I had X, then I would…”).
- Feature requests stated as solutions (“You should add a button that…”).
- Opinions about ideal solutions that are not grounded in observed behavior.
