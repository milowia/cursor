# Idea Validation – Create PRD

- **When to use**: The user wants to turn a product idea or opportunity into a **lean PRD** focused on learning and validation (not a big, waterfall spec).
- **Scope**: Work only on **one idea / opportunity** at a time. If the user mixes several ideas, first help them pick or split into separate PRDs.

## Goal

Guide the user to a concise PRD that:
- Clarifies the **problem, users, and desired outcome**.
- States the **hypotheses and assumptions** to validate.
- Defines a **smallest-viable experiment / MVP** to test the idea.
- Captures **risks, metrics, and decision criteria** for whether to proceed.

## Required inputs

Before drafting, make sure you understand:
- The **product / domain** and target **user / segment**.
- The **problem or opportunity** the idea is addressing.
- Any **existing insights** (user research, data, feedback).

If any of this is missing, ask **2–4 focused questions** to fill the gaps before writing the PRD.

## PRD structure

Produce the PRD as Markdown with clear sections such as:
- **1. Context & Background**
- **2. Problem & Target Users**
- **3. Goals & Success Metrics**
- **4. Hypotheses & Key Assumptions**
- **5. Proposed Solution (Concept)**
- **6. Validation Plan / MVP**
- **7. Risks & Open Questions**

Tailor headings slightly to the user’s company style if they share an example.

## Process

1. **Clarify the problem**
   - Rephrase the idea as a **problem statement** focused on users and outcomes.
   - Push back gently if the user jumps straight to features without a clear problem.

2. **Define goals and metrics**
   - Ask what success looks like in terms of **user behavior** and **business impact**.
   - Suggest 2–4 concrete, measurable indicators (activation, conversion, retention, NPS, task success, etc.).

3. **Capture hypotheses**
   - Turn assumptions into explicit **hypothesis statements** (format like: “We believe that… for… will result in…”).
   - Highlight the **riskiest assumptions** first (value risk, usability, feasibility, viability).

4. **Shape a lean solution**
   - Propose a **minimal, testable concept**, not a full-blown product.
   - Offer 2–3 options when there are clear trade-offs, and briefly compare them.

5. **Design the validation / MVP plan**
   - Suggest **smallest experiments**: prototypes, fake-door tests, concierge, A/B tests, usability tests, etc.
   - For each experiment, specify: objective, method, who, sample size (rough), timeline, and what decision it will inform.

6. **Write the PRD**
   - Fill in all sections in a **concise, skimmable** way (bullets over long paragraphs).
   - Use the user’s terminology (product, team, metrics) where possible.

7. **Review and iterate**
   - End with a short checklist: “Things to confirm with the team / stakeholders”.
   - Offer to refine specific sections (e.g. metrics, validation plan) if the user asks.

## Quality bar

- The PRD should be **readable by non-technical stakeholders** (PMs, designers, leadership).
- It should enable a team to **start validation work immediately** without guessing intent.
- Keep it to a **lean artifact**: enough detail to act, not a long essay.
