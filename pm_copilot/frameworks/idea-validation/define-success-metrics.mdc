# Idea Validation – Define Success Metrics

- **When to use**: The user is shaping or refining a PRD or idea validation plan and needs **clear, actionable success metrics**.
- **Primary focus**: Clarify the **North Star Metric** and a small set of **input metrics** that drive it, while keeping **output metrics** in view.

## Goal

By the end of the interaction, the user should have:
- A well-articulated **North Star Metric**.
- 2–5 **input (leading) metrics** that they can influence in the near term.
- Clear links from input metrics to **output (lagging) metrics** and business outcomes.

## Key concepts to apply

- **North Star Metric (NSM)**:
  - One metric that best captures the **core value** the product delivers to users.
  - Should reflect **user value**, not just internal activity.
  - Everything else (features, campaigns, experiments) is a **lever** to move this metric.

- **Output (lagging) metrics**:
  - Outcomes you ultimately care about (e.g. revenue, churn, LTV, NRR).
  - They move more slowly and are influenced by many factors.

- **Input (leading) metrics**:
  - User behaviors or product usage patterns that **drive** the outputs (e.g. activation rate, feature adoption, weekly active teams, completion rate of key workflow).
  - These are what the team can **directly influence** with product changes and experiments.

In PRDs, prioritize **input metrics** as targets, and **explicitly connect** them to the relevant output metrics.

## Process

1. **Clarify product value and lifecycle**
   - Ask what core value the product delivers and at what key moments (e.g. onboarding, first success, repeat usage).
   - Identify the most important **user actions** that represent value being realized.

2. **Define or refine the North Star Metric**
   - Propose candidate NSMs based on the product’s value (e.g. “weekly active teams completing X workflow”, “messages sent per active workspace per week”).
   - Ensure the NSM:
     - Reflects **value to users**, not just internal output.
     - Is **measurable and segmentable** (by cohort, plan, product area).
     - Can be reasonably **influenced over time** by the team.

3. **Map output metrics**
   - Ask which **business outcomes** matter most for this initiative (e.g. revenue, churn, expansion, NPS).
   - List 1–3 key **output metrics** related to the idea or PRD.

4. **Identify input metrics**
   - For each output metric and for the NSM, identify **leading behaviors** that drive them (e.g. activation, feature adoption, depth of usage, collaboration behaviors).
   - Turn these into **concrete, measurable input metrics** (e.g. “% of new users who complete onboarding within 1 day”, “# of teams that use feature X weekly”).
   - Keep the list focused: **2–5 input metrics** per PRD.

5. **Connect input to output**
   - For each input metric, explicitly note which **output metric(s)** it is expected to influence.
   - Encourage the user to phrase this as a simple mapping (e.g. “If we increase activation from 40% → 60%, we expect churn to decrease because…”).

6. **Set targets and time horizons**
   - Help the user set **realistic, directional targets** (e.g. “increase activation from 30% → 45% in 1 quarter”).
   - Emphasize that for early idea validation, **directional improvement** and learning are often more important than exact numbers.

7. **Summarize in a metrics section**
   - Produce a concise Markdown section like:
     - **North Star Metric**
     - **Output Metrics**
     - **Input Metrics & Links to Outputs**
   - Keep it skimmable with bullets and short explanations.

## Quality bar

- Metrics are **specific, measurable, and behavior-driven**, not vague (“increase engagement”).
- The **North Star Metric** clearly reflects user value and is not just vanity.
- Each input metric is clearly **linked** to one or more output metrics.
- The resulting section is easy for stakeholders to read and **immediately usable** in a PRD or experiment plan.
